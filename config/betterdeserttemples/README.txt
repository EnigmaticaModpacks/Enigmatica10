This directory is for a few additional options for YUNG's Better Desert Temples.
Options provided may vary by version.
This directory contains subdirectories for supported versions. The first time you run Better Desert Temples, a version subdirectory will be created if that version supports advanced options.
For example, the first time you use Better Desert Temples for 1.21 on NeoForge, the 'neoforge-1_21' subdirectory will be created in this folder.
If no subdirectory for your version is created, then that version probably does not support the additional options.
NOTE -- MOST OPTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN A CONFIG FILE OUTSIDE THIS FOLDER!
For example, on NeoForge 1.21 the file is 'betterdeserttemples-neoforge-1_21.toml'.
